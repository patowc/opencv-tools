The basic idea for this tool started when playing with Magic Mirror 2 at home.
Magic Mirror (https://docs.magicmirror.builders/) is an awesome project that,
among many other modules and functionalities, can integrate facial recognition
 tools, so you can detect the person in front of the mirror.

As far as I was going deeper on the modules, I had some problems with existing
functionalities and python tools based on OpenCV. In particular, with models
training and capture tools.

So, I started patching the original project (MMM-Facial-Recognition-Tools) but
in the end, I started rewriting everything with new strategies. Now it is a
different package that I'm trying to build in an automagic approach, so the
users can just invoke autorun.py and see everything set up automatically.

Building a package was the next logical step :)
